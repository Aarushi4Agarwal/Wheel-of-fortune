THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL
SEE EYE TO EYE
WHEN PIGS FLY
TO COST AN ARM AND LEG
A PIECE OF CAKE
LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG
TO CUT CORNERS
TO KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
HEAD OVER HEELS
JAMES BOND
BREAK THE ICE
COST AN ARM AND A LEG
CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
THROW IN THE TOWEL
